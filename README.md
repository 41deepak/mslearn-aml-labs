## Prerequisites

Azure Machine Learning (Azure ML) is a Microsoft Azure-based service for running data science and machine learning workloads at scale in the cloud. To use Azure Machine Learning, you will need an Azure subscription. If you do not already have one, you can sign up for a free trial at [https://azure.microsoft.com](https://azure.microsoft.com).

## Setup

Before completing any of the labs in this repository, you must follow the instructions in [Lab 1 - Getting Started with Azure Machine Learning](./labdocs/Lab01.md) to create an Azure Machine Learning workspace and set up a compute instance to work on.

## Completing the Labs

Complete the labs in order by following the links on the [Lab Exercises](./labdocs/README.md) page.

Before completing each lab, we recommend you complete the associated training on [Microsoft Learn](https://azure.com/learn).
